## Overview :
The HR Analytics Project is a data-driven initiative aimed at optimizing human resource management and decision-making within an organization. By leveraging data analytics techniques, this project seeks to provide insights into various HR-related aspects, ultimately enhancing employee retention, engagement, and organizational performance.

## Objective :
The primary objective of this HR analytics project is to:
1) Improve Employee Retention: Identify factors contributing to employee turnover and develop strategies to retain top talent.
2) Enhance Employee Engagement: Analyze employee satisfaction and engagement data to create a more positive work environment.
3) Optimize Recruitment: Utilize data-driven insights to streamline the recruitment process, identifying the best sources for hiring top talent.
4) Predict Promotions: Develop predictive models to identify employees most likely to be promoted based on their performance and qualifications.

## Datasets :
1) Employee Demographics and HR Records
This dataset contains information about employee demographics, work history, job roles, departments, and performance records.
2) Employee Satisfaction Surveys. 
These datasets include employee responses to satisfaction and engagement surveys, providing insights into job satisfaction and workplace culture.
